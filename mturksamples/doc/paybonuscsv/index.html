<h1>PayBonusCSV</h1>

<description>PayBonusCSV is a utility that uses the Mechanical Turk
  API in Java to pay bonuses to a number of workers in batch.</description>

<p> PayBonusCSV is built on top of the Mechanical Turk sample package,
  and uses the <b>Apache ANT</b> utility to both compile and execute
  the java script.

<h2>File Setup</h2>

Before running the script, you must set up the csv input file and let
the script know the secret key for your Mechanical Turk account.
<br>
The <code>testinp.csv</code> file is included in
the <code>samples</code> directory.  Each line contains a
comma-separated list consisting of the assignment ID, the worker ID,
the bonus amount and the reason for paying (in that order).
<p>
<output>
2C21QP6AUC26ERQ7ZEO3Y0FK0QG81X,A27ANNY9E0URA2,0.5,because
<br>2C21QP6AUC26ERQ7ZEO3Y0FK0QG81X,A27ANNY9E0URA2,1,Good job!
<br>2C21QP6AUC26ERQ7ZEO3Y0FK0QG81X,A27ANNY9E0URA2,2.22,Thank you.
</output>
<p>
This file pays three different bonuses to the same worker for the same
assignment (but for different reasons).  Notice that including commas
(,) in the reason may lead to unexpected results.  You may use a
spreadsheet program such as excel to create your own csv file, and you
may save it anywhere on your hard drive.

The file <code>mturk.properties</code> contains the relevant keys to
access your account.  You can find your access keys by going to
aws.amazon.com, hovering your mouse over "Your Web Services Account"
in the top-right corner and selecting View Access Key Identifiers. Be
sure to log-in with the same username and password you registered with
your Mechanical Turk Requester account.
<p>In the same file, choose the
appropriate <code>service_url</code> for either the developer sandbox
(to test things) or the production side (if you are confident that
your system is correctly set-up).

<h2>Running</h2>

To run the script, open a terminal and navigate to the directory
containing the <code>build.xml</code> file.  Type <code>ant</code> at
the command line, to verify that ant is installed:
<p>
<output>
<br>bash-3.2$ ant
<br>Buildfile: /Users/astorer/Work/eclipse/mturksamples/build.xml
<br>
<br>help:
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant helloworld' to run the MTurkHelloWorld application.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant survey' to run the Simple Survey application.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant image' to run the Best Image application.  Use the optional ' -Dpreview=[preview file name]' parameter to preview.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant category' to run the Site Category application.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant reviewerForHIT -DhitID=[the HIT ID]' to run the Reviewer application.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant reviewerForHITFile -Dsuccess_file=[filename of .success file]' -Doutput_file=[filename of output file] to run the Reviewer application.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant paybonus -DassignID=[assignment id] -DworkerID=[the worker ID] -Dbonusamt=[the Bonus Amount] -dReason=[the reason for the bonus]' to run the paybonus application.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant paybonuscsv -Dbonuscsv=[filename of .csv file] to pay bonuses in batch specified by the csv file.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant filter' to run the MyHIT application which uses the AppendKeywordFilter.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant compile-sample' to compile the sample code.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant jar' to build the sdk sources and create jar.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant run-test' to run the junit tests for the sdk.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant doc' to create javadocs for the sdk and sample java sources.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant dist' to create the all distributables of the sdk.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant unix' to create the gzip distributable of the sdk for unix.
<br>     [echo] Run 'ant windows' to create the zip distributable of the sdk for windows.
<br>
<br>BUILD SUCCESSFUL
<br>Total time: 4 seconds
</output>
<p>
This output demonstrates that ant is installed, and is referring to
the correct <code>build.xml</code> file.  To run the PayBonusCSV
script, type <code>ant paybonuscsv -Dbonuscsv=[location]</code>
<p>
Make sure you include the entire path to the file, e.g.:
<output>
bash-3.2$ ant paybonuscsv
-Dbonuscsv="/Users/astorer/Work/eclipse/mturksamples/samples/testinp.csv"
</output>
<p>
As the script runs, it will echo back the information sent to the
Mechanical Turk servers, and finally report a summary of the actions
taken:
<output>
     [java] Awarded a total of $3.72 to 3 workers.
</output>
